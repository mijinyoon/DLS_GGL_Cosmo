# DLS_GGL_Cosmo

First time using Github as a writer.
Hope to get used to it soon and start sharing my awesome codes! :) 
Will make it grow!

I need to normalize the powerspectrum codes. 
Also needs to make it dependent of redshift. 
Then, I will transform P_nonlin to P_delta((\ell + 1/2)/f_k, \chi). 
Those 3 steps will complete the codes for now.
